Smart Home
This project is about making smart home with Raspberry Pi, but in this case, we use lego house as alternative house.
There are 3 features in total: turn light off and on, open and close door & make a fan turn on whenever the temperature start to 
become hotter & everything will be controlled via smart phone.
